/* The datatables' theme css file doesn't define
the color but with white background. It leads to an issue that
when the HTML's body color is set to 'white', the user can't
see the text since the background is white. One case is in the
RStudio's IDE when inline viewing the DT table in a Rmd file.
This fixes should have no side-effects because all the datatables'
themes use the black text actually. Event if it doesn't, it will
override this CSS definition.
